  <h3>Communities</h3>

  <div class="alert alert-secondary">
    <p>Unbiased and objective evaluations of bioinformatics resources are challenging to set up and can only be effective
      when built and implemented around community driven efforts. Thus, in <b>OpenEBench</b> we gather several community
      initiatives which
      establish standards and automated services to facilitate scientific benchmarking.</p>
    <p>These efforts provide a way for software developers to implement more efficient methods, tools and web services by
      comparing their performance on previously agreed datasets and metrics with other similar resources and, more
      importantly, help end-users
      that tend to have difficulties in choosing the right tool for the problem at hand, and are not necessarily aware of
      the latest developments in each of the fields of the bioinformatics methods they need to use.</p>
