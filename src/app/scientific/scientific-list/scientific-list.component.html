  <p>Unbiased and objective evaluations of bioinformatics resources are challenging to set up and can only be effective
    when built and implemented around community driven efforts. Thus, in <b>OpenEBench</b> we gather several community
    initiatives which
    establish standards and automated services to facilitate scientific benchmarking.</p>
  <p>These efforts provide a way for software developers to implement more efficient methods, tools and web services by
    comparing their performance on previously agreed datasets and metrics with other similar resources and, more
    importantly, help end-users
    that tend to have difficulties in choosing the right tool for the problem at hand, and are not necessarily aware of
    the latest developments in each of the fields of the bioinformatics methods they need to use.</p>
