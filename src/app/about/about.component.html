        OpenEBench: the ELIXIR platform for benchmarking
    </h3>
    <p>
        OpenEBench (https://openebench.bsc.es) is the ELIXIR benchmarking and
        technical monitoring platform for bioinformatics tools, web servers and
        workflows. OpenEBench is part of the ELIXIR Tools platform and its
        development is led by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in
        collaboration with partners within ELIXIR and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the ELIXIR project, OpenEBench is being developed under the Tools
        Platform at the Work Package 2 (WP2: Benchmarking)
        (https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/tools).
    </p>

    <p>
        All OpenEBench components have been designed and implemented following
        the recommendations made by the ELIXIR tools platform e.g. making code
        available in public repositories from day 1; are available as software
        containers, and use workflow managers promoted by ELIXIR. Next figure
        illustrates the interconnection of OpenEBench to other ELIXIR tools
        platforms systems and platforms and beyond.

    <h4>The goals of OpenEBench</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Provide guidance and software infrastructure for Benchmarking and
            Techincal monitoring of bioinformatics tools.
        </li>
        <li>
            Engage with existing benchmark initiatives making different
            communities aware of the platform.
        </li>
        <li>
            Maintain a data warehouse infrastructure to keep record of
            Benchmarking initiatives.
        </li>
        <li>
            Expose benchmarking and technical monitoring results to Elixir Tools
            registry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Establish and refine communication protocols with communities and/or
            infrastructure projects willing to have a unified benchmark
            infrastructure Coordinate with Elixir.
        </li>
        <li>
            Work with the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform to keep FAIR data
            principles on the Benchmarking data warehouse.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Technical monitoring</h3>
    <p>
        OpenEBench, holds a specific infrastructure to monitor software quality.
        In an initial analysis phase BSC has put together a series of quality
        metrics taken from a number of sources. The source of such metrics
        includes documents by the Software Sustainability Institute,
        recommendations for open source software development, or for software
        quality metrics. For each metric, a specific source of information have
        been chosen and the necessary interface implemented.
    </p>
    <h3>Scientific benchmarking</h3>
    <p>
        Scientific benchmarking helps determine the precision, recall and other
        metrics of bioinformatics resources in unbiased scenarios, which have
        been set up through reference databases, ad-hoc input and test data sets
        reflecting specifying scientific challenges. Chosen metrics allow us to
        objectively evaluate the relative scientific performance of the
        different participating resources. It is even possible to understand
        what are the software potential biases, strengths and weaknesses and/or
        under which conditions do they perform better or worse.
    </p>
    <h4>OEB architecture levels</h4>
    <p>
        OpenEBench scientific benchmarking architecture has three different
        levels that allow communities at different maturity stages to make use
        of the platform.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Level 1</h5>
            Used for the long-term storage of benchmarking events and challenges
            aiming at reproducibility and provenance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Level 2</h5>
            Allows the community to use benchmarking workflows to assess
            participants’ performance. Those workflows compute one or more
            evaluation metrics given one or more reference datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Level 3</h5>
            Goes further by getting workflows specifications from participants,
            and then evaluating them in terms of technical and scientific
            performance. At this level, the whole benchmarking experiment is
            performed at OpenEBench; first, the predictions are made using the
            software provided by the participants, then, those predictions are
            evaluated with the benchmarking workflows, and, finally, the results
            are stored and visualized in the web server.
        </li>
