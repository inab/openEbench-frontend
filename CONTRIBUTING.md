# Contributing

Welcome to OpenEBench Portal front-end contributing guide. This document will help answer common questions you may have during your first contribution. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you do so.

## Issue Reporting

Not every contribution comes in the form of code. Submitting, confirming, and triaging issues is an important task for any project. We use this GitHub repository to track issues related to the OpenEBench Portal front-end. If you discover bugs, have ideas for improvements or new features, please start by opening an issue on this repository. We use issues to centralize the discussion and agree on a plan of action before spending time and effort writing code that might not get used.

### Submitting An Issue
* Check that the issue has not already been reported
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code (a.k.a. master)
* Select the appropriate issue type and open an issue with a descriptive title
* Be clear, concise, and precise using grammatically correct, complete sentences in your summary of the problem
* Include the output of mdl -V or mdl --version
* Include any relevant code in the issue

## Releases

OpenEBench Portal front-end follows partially the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) standard.
Our standard version numbers look like `X.Y` and translates to:
* `X` is a major release: has changes that may be incompatible with prior major releases
* `Y` is a minor release: adds new functionality and bug fixes in a backwards compatible manner
