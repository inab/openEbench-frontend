The goals of OpenEBench are to:    Provide guidance and software infrastructure for Benchmarking and Techincal monitoring of bioinformatics tools.    Engage with existing benchmark initiatives making different communities aware of the platform.    Maintain a data warehouse infrastructure to keep record of Benchmarking initiatives.    Expose benchmarking and technical monitoring results to Elixir Tools registry.    Establish and refine communication protocols with communities and/or infrastructure projects willing to have a unified benchmark infrastructure Coordinate with Elixir.
